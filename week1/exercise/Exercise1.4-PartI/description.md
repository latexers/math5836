## Exercise 1.4 - Part 1

* Create a correlation matrix and pick the best two features for modelling using linear regression. What do you observe about the dataset in general?

* Develop a linear regression model for estimating y1 (heating load) using 60 percent of data picked randomly for training and remaining for testing.  Visualise your model prediction using appropriate plots. Report the RMSE and R-squared score. 

* Try the approach with all input features, i) without normalising input data, ii) with normalising input data. 

* Run 30 experiments each and report the mean and std of the RMSE and R-squared score of the train and test datasets. Write a paragraph to compare your results of the different approaches taken.
