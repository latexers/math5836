## Linear regression for classification problems



* Try developing a linear regression model for binary classification using the step transfer function using the data produced from Iris binary classification case (class 0 is Iris-setosa and and rest are class 1). Use 60 percent of data picked randomly for training and remaining for testing. 

* Try the approach with all 4 input features, i) without normalising input data, ii) with normalising input data. Report percentage correctly classified in training and test set after fixed number of training time (iterations) using gradient descent.

* Carry out 30 experiments for both cases with different initial random seeds. Report mean and standard deviation using the appropriate metrics (accuracy, RMSE or AUC) for your results. 



Step function is given below:

f(x) = 1, x>=0 = 0, x<0
